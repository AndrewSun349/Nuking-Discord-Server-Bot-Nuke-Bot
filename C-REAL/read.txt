Builder HTML can help you to build a config file that is need for the bot.
if the config file is called default.json and its in the same directory as the bot
the bot will always try to look for that file first and open it. If the bot can't find
default.json next to it., then the bot will ask you for a config file. If you already have
a config file, but it's not named default.json or some where else in the system, then
you can enter a full path or a local path to find the config file.
